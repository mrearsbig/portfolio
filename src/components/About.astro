    I'm a <span class="text-foreground">systems engineer</span> passionate about
    building <span class="text-foreground">reliable</span> and
    <span class="text-foreground">scalable backend systems</span>, where
    <span class="text-foreground">solid engineering</span> meets
    <span class="text-foreground">thoughtful design</span>. In the last year,
    I've transformed <span class="text-foreground">complex problems</span> into
    <span class="text-foreground">elegant solutions</span>—turning
    <span class="text-foreground">business rules</span> into
    <span class="text-foreground">clean architectures</span> and
    <span class="text-foreground">well-structured APIs</span> that elevate the
    overall product experience.
  </p>
  <p class="text-muted-foreground">
    Although my main focus is <span class="text-foreground"
      >backend development</span
    > and <span class="text-foreground">modern architectures</span>, I also
    bring practical experience with
    <span class="text-foreground">Angular</span> and
    <span class="text-foreground">React</span>. This helps me create
    <span class="text-foreground">seamless integrations</span> and ensure that
    <span class="text-foreground">backend and frontend</span> communicate with
    precision and consistency, maintaining a complete and well-rounded view of
    the product.
  </p>
  <p class="text-muted-foreground">
    Beyond coding, I channel my passion for design into personal projects, such
    as crafting my <span class="text-foreground"
      >personal brand identity</span
    > and exploring <span class="text-foreground">UI/UX principles</span> from a
    developer's perspective. I actively participate in
    <span class="text-foreground">tech communities</span>, believing that
    <span class="text-foreground">collaborative learning</span> drives innovation.
  </p>
  <p class="text-muted-foreground">
    When I'm not coding, you'll find me playing as a <span
      class="text-foreground">creative midfielder</span
    > on weekend soccer matches, <span class="text-foreground">gaming</span> (currently
    <span class="text-foreground">Call of Duty: Warzone</span> and
    <span class="text-foreground">EA Sports FC</span>), or
    <span class="text-foreground">traveling</span> to experience new cultures while
    hunting for the world's best
    <span class="text-foreground">empanadas</span>.
  </p>
  <p class="text-muted-foreground">
    I thrive in <span class="text-foreground">teams</span> where
    <span class="text-foreground">curiosity fuels progress</span>. Let's build
    solutions that don't just work—but <span class="text-foreground"
      >inspire</span
    >.
