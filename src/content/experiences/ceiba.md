Designed and implemented end-to-end solutions using Angular and ASP.NET Core, optimizing internal processes by 10%. Additionally, I developed RESTful APIs that reduced response times by 8-10%, enhancing system efficiency. I applied design patterns (CQRS, MVC, Repository) to simplify maintenance and scalability, cutting support efforts by 10-15%. Through active participation in agile teams, I conducted code reviews and contributed to architecture definitions, strengthening team cohesion and elevating product quality.
